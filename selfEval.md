# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? 
**The comparison operators make sense to me and I feel comfortable translating comparisons into their corresponding operators.**
2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? 
**The two logical operators we learned, && and ||, are easy for me to understand and I feel comfortable using them!**
3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
**I am confused on when to use "else" and when to use "else if" statements. I thought "else if" was used when you want to add addtional conditions to consider and "else" was for an either or option... As I'm typing this I realize that "else" is used for the reponse if the initial conditional statement is false? And "else if" adds addtional conditions to consider?**
4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? 
**I just spend maybe 2+ hours on this assignment? I took me longer than expected.**
5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? 
**I want to practice writing if statements. If I have time after completing my other assignments, I will come back and do the additional, more spicy challenges. I probably won't have time by tonight, but I will work on them before Mod 1 begins.**
6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
**My questions surrounding else vs else if were mostly answered by re-reading the Mod 0 curriculum page. I will do more research on google though, and I think by practicing other "If statement" scenarios, I will gain a better understanding as I figure out how to execute the function.**
